                Kamvelihle Innocent was born on the 31st of January in 1995 in St. Patricks Hospital in Bizana in the Eastern Cape province in 
                South African. He is a Xhosa speaking being but also fluent in English and Zulu, African by race and Xhosa by ethic. Innocent was
                born with no disability, but unfortunately anticipated a disability along the way, he is now partial blind (he can't see by his right 
                eye but he looks normal). Kamvelihle has no criminal record at the moment and still single by marital status.
