                Kamvelihle Innocent is the son of Mongezi Mandisi Jika and Fikisiwe Khethiwe Jika, but got a different surname because he was born 
                before marriage. It is customary in Xhosa community that a child should use mother's surname if born before marriage or else the father 
                will have to pay a couple of cows, unfortunately his father could afford the price.
